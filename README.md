<h1>Memory Game</h1>
<p>A memory game created with Java and JavaSwing as the GUI, this is my first time using JavaSWING and 
have been learning it as I go along.</p>
<p>Currently each part of the game creates a new frame however I have learned that creating new panels would be a more efficient and practical way to implement my GUI which I plan to change in the future.</p>
