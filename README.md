<h1>Memory Game</h1>
<p>A memory game created with Java and JavaSwing as the GUI, this is my first time using JavaSWING and 
have been learning it as I go along.</p>
<p>Alot of the code is all in one class, refactoring is a goal for the future, or as I develop more, when creating I will refactor as I go, however, this was a learning process for GUI's.</p>
<p>Currently each part of the game creates a new frame however I have learned that creating new panels would be a more efficient and practical way to implement my GUI which I plan to change in the future.</p>
